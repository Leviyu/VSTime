14	Measured time	Travel time anomaly of phase onset relative to PREM (observed minus PREM)
15	Predicted time	Travel time prediction of the PREM model
16	Phase start	The start time, relative to PREM prediction, of the beginning of the time window used to define one pulse width of the phase on velocity recordings, measured at the 10% amplitude level preceding the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
17	Phase end	The end time, relative to the PREM prediction, of the end of the time window used to define one pulse width of the phase on velocity recordings, measured at the 10% amplitude level following the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
18	SNRvirtual_average_amp	Virtual station signal-to-noise measurement from the average amplitude of the signal to the average amplitude of the noise, as in equation (2)
19	SNRaverage_record	Average SNRaverage_amp measurements of all records that is used to stack for virtual station
20	SNRpeak_trough	Virtual station signal-to-noise measurement from the maximum peak-to-trough measurement within one period of the signal compared to noise, as in equation (3)
21	MisfitSIGNAL	The average difference between the virtual station phase and the best-fit SEW over one period (see Equation 1)
22	MisfitPRE	As above, except over one period preceding the phase
23	MisfitPOST	As above, except over one period following the phase
24	t* 	The best-fit t* value that, when convolved with the SEW, gives the best fit to records that are broader than the SEW
25	Stretch factor	A measure of the amount the SEW has to be narrowed to fit records that are narrower than the SEW 
26	CCC[rec,SEW]	Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and the best-fitting SEW adapted to the record
27	CCC[rec,GEW]	Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and GEW, which measures the record’s fit to the average phase shape for the event
28	g_best-fit_SEW	Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (equation 5) to a record’s best-fitting SEW
29	g_event_SEW	Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (equation 5) to the S wave SEW for the event (i.e., unstretched, un-t*’ed, as in Step 3, Section 3.1) 
30	Misfitg	The misfit measured between g_best-fit_SEW and g_event_SEW (computed as in equation 1) which provides a different measure of record broadening
31	w_comprehensive	An empirical comprehensive weight value for each data (see equation 6)
32	Noise window traffic flag	Records that have “traffic” (other seismic waves) predicted to arrive in the noise window (of the SNR measurement) are flagged as 1, otherwise 0
33	Period	Estimated period of the phase, from the start and end of the pulse measured at 0.1 amplitude (when peak is set to 1) measured on displacement recordings
34	Polarity	The predicted amplitude between [-1,1] using the SH radiation pattern
35	QUALITY	The predicted quality flag, 1 means it is accepted, -1 means it is rejected
36	PICK	Save as QUALITY, expect that this flag is corrected manually to reflect our choice accepting or rejecting the virtual stack
