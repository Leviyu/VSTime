13	Phase name		Either S, Sdiff, SS, SSm, S3, S3m, S4, S4m, S5, S5m, S6m, ScS, ScS2, ScS3, ScS3m, ScS4, ScS4m, ScS5, or ScS5m 
14	Predicted time	Travel time prediction of the PREM model
15	Measured time	Travel time anomaly of phase onset relative to PREM (observed minus PREM)
16	Corrected time	Travel time anomaly of phase onset relative to PREM (observed minus PREM) corrected for over-broadened virtual station stack
17	Phase start	The start time, relative to PREM prediction, of the beginning of the time window used to define one pulse width of VS phase of interest on velocity recordings, measured at the 10% amplitude level preceding the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
18	Phase end	The end time, relative to the PREM prediction, of the end of the time window used to define one pulse width of VS phase of interest on velocity recordings, measured at the 10% amplitude level following the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
19	SNR_VS			VS SNR measurement from the average amplitude of the signal to the average amplitude of the noise
20	SNR Average 	SNR of all records used to create a VS stack 
21	SNRpeak_trough	VS SNR measurement from the maximum peak-to-trough value within one period of the signal compared to noise
22	MisfitSIGNAL	The average difference between the VS phase and the best-fit SEW over one period (as in Equation 2)
23	MisfitPRE		As above, except over one period preceding the phase of interest
24	MisfitPOST		As above, except over one period following the phase of interest
25	t* 				The best-fit t* value that, when convolved with the SEW, gives the best-fit to records that are broader than the SEW
26	Stretch factor	A measure of the amount the SEW has to be narrowed to fit records that are narrower than the SEW 
27	CCC[rec,SEW]	Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and the best-fitting SEW adapted to the record
28	CCC[rec,GEW]	Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and the GEW, which measures the record’s fit to the average S wave phase shape for the event
29	g_best-fit_SEW	Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (g, Equation 1) to a record’s best-fitting SEW
30	g_event_SEW	Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (g, Equation 1) to the GEW for the event 
31	Misfitg	The misfit measured between g_best-fit_SEW and g_event_SEW (computed as in Equation 2) which provides a different measure of record broadening
32	w_comprehensive	An empirical comprehensive weight value for each data (see Equation 3)
33	Noise window traffic flag	Records that have “traffic” (interfering seismic waves) predicted to arrive in the noise window (of the SNR measurement) are flagged as 1, otherwise 0
34	Period	Estimated period of the phase, from the start and end of the pulse measured at 0.1 amplitude (when peak is set to 1) measured on displacement recordings
35	Polarity	The predicted amplitude between [-1,1] using the SH radiation pattern for the phase of interest
