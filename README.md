## Comprehensive dataset constructed with Empirical Wavelet and Virtual Stacking

This comprehensive dataset is constructed with Empirical Wavelet and is presented as supplimentary material for [Travel Time and Waveform Measurements of Global Multi-Bounce Seismic Waves Using Virtual Station Seismogram Stacks ].

Two files are provided in csv format and the header is explained in the corresponding header file (Please refer to the paper for more information). The two files are:
1. Multiple-bounce phase single station file - 'eventinfo.multi_phase_single_pick.csv'
2. Virtual Stack file - 'eventinfo.virtual_stack.all.csv'

We encourage user to refer to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3247094), as it contains our latest update on the dataset as well as the doi for the dataset.
